# One Piece: Grand Line Rappin'
One Piece: Grand Line Rappin' is a One Piece-themed Friday Night Funkin' mod, heavily influenced by the Bandai Namco One Piece games (though it's not affiliated with them).

# ☠️📖 SYNOPSIS 📖☠️
Boyfriend and Girlfriend settled down on some One Piece. Daddy Dearest, in a yet another plot to get rid of Boyfriend, used his powers to throw him into the TV. Girlfriend, unhappy with what her father did, jumps into the TV with her boyfriend, much to Daddy Dearest's dismay. The two lovebirds then land on the Thousand Sunny, the ship of the Straw Hat Pirates. There, they meet the crew of the ship, with Luffy, of course asking the two of them to join his crew. Boyfriend declines, but asks Luffy for a rap battle. Luffy accepts and the 2 of them sing a shanty among the high seas, with Girlfriend, Nami, and Robin watching their rap battle.

(This mod is set between Post-Enies Lobby Arc and Thriller Bark Arc)
